Feel free to tell me how wrong I am, thx !\r\n\r\nCoffeeLife\r\n==========\r\n\r\nConway's Game of Life in coffee script\r\n\r\nRULES\r\n=======\r\nThe universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\r\n\r\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.\r\n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\r\n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.\r\n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
